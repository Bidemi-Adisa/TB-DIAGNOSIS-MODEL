Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge (Farhat et al., 2024), especially in low-resource settings, leading to considerable morbidity and mortality. Conventional diagnostic approaches, such as chest X-rays, skin tests, and sputum smear microscopy, are often costly, time-consuming, and inaccessible in remote areas, posing a barrier to timely diagnosis and effective treatment (Zaporojan et al., 2024). This study investigates the application of Machine Learning (ML) techniques, specifically a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model and a Random Forest Classifier, to predict pulmonary TB using patient symptom data. The objective is to develop a highly accurate, non-invasive diagnostic model that addresses the issue of imbalanced datasets typically found in medical data, where negative cases outnumber positive ones by a significant margin (Rahman and Davis, 2013). Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC score, were used to assess the effectiveness of the models. The study concluded that both the MLP and Random Forest models could predict TB, with the Random Forest model exhibiting a superior accuracy of 93% a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 100%. This research contributes to the knowledge of using ML in healthcare by presenting a practical approach to improving TB diagnosis using non-invasive methods. The findings suggest that ML models, particularly the Random Forest Classifier model, can serve as a dependable alternative to traditional TB diagnostic methods, thus aiding in early detection and reducing the spread of TB.
